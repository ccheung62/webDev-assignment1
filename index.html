    <p>The Shiba Inu (柴犬, Japanese: [ɕiba inɯ]) is a breed of hunting dog from Japan. A small-to-medium breed, it is the
        smallest of the six original and distinct spitz breeds of dog native to Japan.[1] Its name literally translates
        to "brushwood dog", as it is used to flush game.

        A small, alert, and agile dog that copes very well with mountainous terrain and hiking trails, the Shiba Inu was
        originally bred for hunting.[1][2] It looks similar to other Japanese dog breeds such as the Akita Inu or
        Hokkaido, but the Shiba Inu is a different breed with a distinct bloodline, temperament, and smaller size than
        other Japanese dog breeds.</p>
